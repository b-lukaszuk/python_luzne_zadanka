# Description

Selected tasks/projects from "The Big Book of Small Python Projects" by Al Sweigart solved 'at a whim'.

Probably I will solve them using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

In that case usage will be like:

``` bash
jupyter notebook
```

and then choosing `*.ipynb` file in a browser window.


Alternatively I will solve them in text `*.py` files

In that case usage will be like:

``` bash
python3 main.py
```
