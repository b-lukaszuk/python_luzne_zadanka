## Description

In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number
based on clues. The game offers one of the following hints in response to your
guess: “Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place, “Fermi”
when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your
guess has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the secret number.
