## Description

The Birthday Paradox, also called the Birthday Problem, is the surprisingly high
probability that two people will have the same birthday even in a small group of
people. In a group of 70 people, there’s a 99.9 percent chance of two people
having a matching birthday. But even in a group as small as 23 people, there’s a
50 percent chance of a matching birthday.

## My Notes

I already solved this problem and solution is to be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/python_luzne_zadanka/tree/a63e05fe76e2579f1d46309e5c90cdcfc2c411dc/part1_18_11_2021/task5).

I will not repeat myself and skip writing this solution again.
