## Title

Arithmetic

(Part 1, Exercise 10 from the book)

## Description

Create a program that reads two integers, a and b, from the user. Your program should compute and display:

- The sum of a and b
- The difference when b is subtracted from a
- The product of a and b
- The quotient when a is divided by b
- The remainder when a is divided by b
- The result of log10 a
- The result of a to the power of b

## Title

Distance Between Two Points on Earth

(Part 1, Exercise 12 from the book)

## Description

The surface of the Earth is curved, and the distance between degrees of longitude varies with latitude. As a result, finding the distance between two points on the surface of the Earth is more complicated than simply using the Pythagorean theorem.

Let (t1, g1) and (t2, g2) be the latitude and longitude of two points on the Earth’s surface. The distance between these points, following the surface of the Earth, in kilometers is:

<pre>
distance = 6371.01 × arccos(sin(t1) × sin(t2) + cos(t1) × cos(t2) × cos(g1 − g2))
</pre>

The value 6371.01 in the previous equation wasn’t selected at random. It is the average radius of the Earth in kilometers.

Create a program that allows the user to enter the latitude and longitude of two points on the Earth in degrees. Your program should display the distance between the points, following the surface of the earth, in kilometers.

Hint: Python’s trigonometric functions operate in radians. [...] The math module contains a function named radians which converts from degrees to radians.

## Title

Making Change

(Part 1, Exercise 13 from the book)

## Description

Write a program that begins by reading a number of cents from the user as an integer. Then your program should compute and display the denominations of the coins that should be used to give that amount of change to the shopper. The change should be given using as few coins as possible. Assume that the machine is loaded with pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, loonies and toonies.

## My notes

penny - 1/100th of a dollar, a cent
nickel - five centes
dime - ten cents
quarter - 25 cents
loonie - 1 dollar coin in Canada (hint from the book)
toonie - 2 dollar coin in Canada (hint from the book)

## Title

Free Fall

(Part 1, Exercise 19 from the book)

## Description

Create a program that determines how quickly an object is traveling when it hits the ground. The user will enter the height from which the object is dropped in meters (m). Because the object is dropped its initial speed is 0 m/s. Assume that the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2. You can use the formula vf = sqrt(v_i^2 + 2ad) to compute the final speed, vf, when the initial speed, vi, acceleration, a, and distance, d, are known.

## Title

Area of a Regular Polygon

(Part 1, Exercise 23 from the book)

## Description

A polygon is regular if its sides are all the same length and the angles between all of the adjacent sides are equal. The area of a regular polygon can be computed using the following formula, where `s` is the length of a side and `n` is the number of sides:

<pre>
area = (n * s^2) / (4 * tan(PI / n))
</pre>

Write a program that reads s and n from the user and then displays the area of a regular polygon constructed from these values.

## Title

Day Old Bread

(Part 1, Exercise 33 from the book)

## Description

A bakery sells loaves of bread for $3.49 each. Day old bread is discounted by 60 percent. Write a program that begins by reading the number of loaves of day old bread being purchased from the user. Then your program should display the regular price for the bread, the discount because it is a day old, and the total price. All of the values should be displayed using two decimal places, and the decimal points in all of the numbers should be aligned when reasonable values are entered by the user.
