## Title

Dog Years

(Part 1, Exercise 33 from the book)

## Description

Write a program that implements the conversion from human years to dog years described in the previous paragraph, i.e.

[...] it is better to count each of the first two human years as 10.5 dog years, and then count each additional human year as 4 dog years.


# Task 2

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Title

Chinese Zodiac

(Part 1, Exercise 48 from the book)

## Description

The Chinese zodiac assigns animals to years in a 12 year cycle, e.g.

<pre>
Year: Animal
2000: Dragon
2001: Snake
2002: Horse
2003: Sheep
2004: Monkey
2005: Rooster
2006: Dog
2007: Pig
2008: Rat
2009: Ox
2010: Tiger
2011: Hare
</pre>

Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays the animal associated with that year. Your program should work correctly for any year greater than or equal to zero, not just the ones listed in the table.

## My notes

A year 0 does not exist [see: wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_zero) so instead the lower limit will be year 1.
