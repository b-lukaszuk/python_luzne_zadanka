## Title

Is it a Valid Triangle?

(Part 1, Exercise 88 from the book)

## Description

Write a function that determines whether or not three lengths can form a triangle. The function will take 3 parameters and return a Boolean result. In addition, write a program that reads 3 lengths from the user and demonstrates the behaviour of this function.

# Task 2

## Title

Random Password

(Part 1, Exercise 94 from the book)

[...] Ensure that the `hex2int` function works correctly for both uppercase and lowercase letters. Your functions should end the program with a meaningful error message if an invalid parameter is provided.

## Title

Arbitrary Base Conversions

(Part 1, Exercise 99 from the book)

## Description

Write a program that allows the user to convert a number from one base to another. Your program should support bases between 2 and 16 for both the input number and the result number. 

# Task 6

## Title

Reduce a Fraction to Lowest Terms

(Part 1, Exercise 101 from the book)

## Description

Write a function that takes two positive integers that represent the numerator and denominator of a fraction as its only two parameters. [...] For example, if the parameters passed to the function are 6 and 63 then the function should return 2 and 21.
