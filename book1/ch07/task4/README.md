## Title

Remove Comments

(Part 1, Exercise 150 from the book)

## Description

[...] create a program that removes all of the comments from a Python source file.

## Usage

**WARNING!** The program may accidentally overwrite a file content. Be careful not to do that!

**WARNING!** The input_file.py (file with comments) cannot contain `#` characters that are not comments (e.g. in strings between quotation signs).

```bash
python3 main.py input_file.py output_file.py
```
e.g

```bash
python3 main.py file_with_comments.py file_without_comments.py
```
