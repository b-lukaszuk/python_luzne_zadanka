# Task 1

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Title

Number the Lines in a File

(Part 1, Exercise 144 from the book)

## Description

Create a program that adds line numbers to a file. The name of the input file will be read from the user, as will the name of the new file that your program will create. Each line in the output file should begin with the line number, followed by a colon and a space, followed by the line from the input file.

## My notes

Name of the input file and output file will be read from command line args (so, `sys.argv`).

# Task 2

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Title

Letter Frequencies

(Part 1, Exercise 146 from the book)

## Description

Write a program that [...] displayes the frequencies of all letters in a file. Ignore spaces, punctuation marks, and numbers as you perform this analysis. Your program should be case insensitive [...]. The user will provide the file name as a command line parameter.

# Task 3

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Title

Sum a List of Numbers

(Part 1, Exercise 148 from the book)

## Description

Create a program that sums all of the numbers entered by the user while ignoring any lines entered by the user that are not valid numbers. Your program should display the current sum after each number is entered. It should display an appropriate error message after any invalid input, and then continue to sum any additional numbers entered by the user. Your program should exit when the user enters a blank line. Ensure that your program works correctly for both integers and floating point numbers.

# Task 4

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Title

Remove Comments

(Part 1, Exercise 150 from the book)

## Description

[...] create a program that removes all of the comments from a Python source file.

# Task 5

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Title

Whatâ€™s that Element Again?

(Part 1, Exercise 152 from the book)

## Description

Write a program that reads a file containing information about chemical elements and stores it in one or more appropriate data structures. Then your program should read and process input from the user. If the user enters an integer then your program should display the symbol and name of the element with the number of protons entered. If the user enters a string then your program should display the number of protons for the element with that name or symbol. [...] Continue to read input from the user until a blank line is entered.

## My Notes

I will download the periodic table of elements from [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table/) as a CSV file.
