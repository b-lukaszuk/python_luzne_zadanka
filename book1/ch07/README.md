## Title

Number the Lines in a File

(Part 1, Exercise 144 from the book)

## Description

Create a program that adds line numbers to a file. The name of the input file will be read from the user, as will the name of the new file that your program will create. Each line in the output file should begin with the line number, followed by a colon and a space, followed by the line from the input file.

## My notes

Name of the input file and output file will be read from command line args (so, `sys.argv`).
