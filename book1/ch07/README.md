## Title

Number the Lines in a File

(Part 1, Exercise 144 from the book)

## Description

Create a program that adds line numbers to a file. The name of the input file will be read from the user, as will the name of the new file that your program will create. Each line in the output file should begin with the line number, followed by a colon and a space, followed by the line from the input file.

## My notes

Name of the input file and output file will be read from command line args (so, `sys.argv`).

## Title

Sum a List of Numbers

(Part 1, Exercise 148 from the book)

## Description

Create a program that sums all of the numbers entered by the user while ignoring any lines entered by the user that are not valid numbers. Your program should display the current sum after each number is entered. It should display an appropriate error message after any invalid input, and then continue to sum any additional numbers entered by the user. Your program should exit when the user enters a blank line. Ensure that your program works correctly for both integers and floating point numbers.
