## Title

Negatives, Zeros and Positives

(Part 1, Exercise 108 from the book)

## Description

Create a program that reads integers from the user until a blank line is entered. Once all of the integers have been read your program should display all of the negative numbers, followed by all of the zeros, followed by all of the positive numbers. Within each group the numbers should be displayed in the same order that they were entered by the user. For example, if the user enters the values 3, -4, 1, 0, -1, 0, and -2 then your program should output the values -4, -1, -2, 0, 0, 3, and 1. Your program should display each value on its own line.

# Task 2

## Title

Perfect Numbers

(Part 1, Exercise 110 from the book)

## Description

Write a function that determines whether or not a positive integer is [perfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number). [...] In addition, write a main program that uses your function to identify and display all of the perfect numbers between 1 and 10,000.

# Task 3

## Title

Random Lottery Numbers

(Part 1, Exercise 114 from the book)

## Description

Write a program that generates a random selection of 6 numbers for a lottery ticket (numbers 1 to 49 without a repetition).

# Task 4

## Title

Line of Best Fit

(Part 1, Exercise 117 from the book)

## Description

Write a program that accepts x,y coordinates of n-points and returns formula for the line of best fit (linear regression):

<pre>
 y = mx + b
</pre>

where:

$$m = {{\sum xy - {(\sum x) (\sum y) \over n}} \over \sum x^2 - {{(\sum x)^2} \over n}}$$

and

$$b = \overline{y} - m \overline{x}$$

Input is taken from the user, the result is printed on the screen.
