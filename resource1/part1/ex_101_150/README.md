# Task 4

Exercise 139

## Description

Write a Python program to valid a IP address.

## My Notes

I will assume I have to check [IPv4 addresses ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address#IPv4_addresses):

<pre>
IPv4 addresses are usually represented in dot-decimal notation, consisting of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, e.g., 192.0.2.1.
</pre>

Additional info, leading zeroes are not allowed, but single zero is OK. Online IPv4 checkers require them to have dots as separators, so I will do that too.
